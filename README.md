**CORE:**

Develop a monitoring system for you house that includes: temperature, humidity, light level, wifi power, tilt detection etc. Stores all these quantities in a database.  Alerting events should be detected, such as: high temperature, high level or low level of lights, low wifi power, tilt etc. Use a colored led or buzzer to spot alerting events and buttons to enable and disable sensors or alert events. Use the display to show status of the monitoring system.

- Micro of your choice
- Sensor or actuators of your choice.

**EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:**

- Github code upload at: [Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/lsUlyCu-)
